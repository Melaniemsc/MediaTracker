# MediaTracker
This site is designed to be a movie and book tracker, you must be logged in to access the features. [click here](https://mediatrackermel.netlify.app)

You can choose from our list of movies and books and add it to your own list,

If you see that what you want to add is not available, an admin can add it for you. 

you can also share what you think and see what others think as well.

### Making of
I feel it was quite fun to make this page visualizing that it could really be useful for me in the future (or for many other people).
The admin connection to add more books and movies is done with an API that I honestly thought was going to be more difficult to handle.
Hope you enjoy my application <3
